"""
Evacuation Prioritization Skill — logic module.

Composes basic API tools with deterministic ranking to produce
a pre-digested evacuation priority list. The LLM calls this as
a single tool instead of chaining 4-5 calls with error risk.

STATUS: Placeholder for next iteration. See SKILL.md for design.

# TODO: Implement in next iteration
